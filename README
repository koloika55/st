My build of suckless st v0.9.2.
Made with lot of patches. Inspired by daddy Luke Smith.
Check patches folder.
Keybinds taken from Lukes st:
## Unique features (using dmenu)

+ **follow urls** by pressing `alt-l`
+ **copy urls** in the same way with `alt-y`
+ **copy the output of commands** with `alt-o`

## Bindings for

+ **scrollback** with `alt-↑/↓` or `alt-pageup/down` or `shift` while scrolling the
  mouse.
+ OR **vim-bindings**: scroll up/down in history with `alt-k` and `alt-j`.
  Faster with `alt-u`/`alt-d`.
+ **zoom/change font size**: same bindings as above, but holding down shift as
  well. `alt-home` returns to default
+ **copy text** with `alt-c`, **paste** is `alt-v` or `shift-insert`
